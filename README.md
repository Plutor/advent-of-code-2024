I am doing [Advent of Code 2024](http://adventofcode.com/2024). I also did [2023](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2023), [2022](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2022) and [2021](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2021).

I am learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) from scratch.

# Learnings

* `npx tsx --watch foo.ts` watches foo.ts for changes and compiles and runs
* In 2024, JavaScript remains an _awful_ language.
* Array indexes are strings, so `for .. in` is a bad idea, I've used C-style `for` loops instead
* Cool, I can't overload functions
* What even is the relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript? I have types in my function 
signatures, and then it lets me compile that code, and then I run into runtime type mismatches. Why is this possible?
* It even let me call `foo(s: string)` with the arguments `int, int[]`, what the hell
* Hey it is enforcing semicolons at the end of each line, though, which means there are rules, but also is mildly annoying because I'm out of practice  there.
