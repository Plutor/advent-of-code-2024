I am doing [Advent of Code 2023](http://adventofcode.com/2024). I also did [2023](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2023), [2022](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2022) and [2021](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2021).

I am learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) from scratch.

# Learnings

* `npx tsx --watch foo.ts` watches foo.ts for changes and compiles and runs
